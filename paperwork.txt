1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EnterpriseML Dashboard is a web-based, automated machine learning platform 
designed to streamline the data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
phase of the ML pipeline. It solves the "cold start" problem in data science by 
allowing users to ingest raw CSV data, clean missing values, apply statistical 
transformations, and generate interactive 3D visualizations without writing code.


2. USER INTERFACE (UI) & DELIVERABLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section details the specific screens the user interacts with and the 
tangible outputs they receive from each module.

2.1 The Dashboard (Landing & Overview)
   - UI Description: Upon uploading a file, the user is presented with a 
     high-level command center.
     * Metrics Cards: Three distinct cards display Total Rows, Total Columns, 
       and Total Missing Cells.
     * Memory Indicator: A badge showing the RAM usage of the dataset in MB.
     * Data Preview: A scrollable table showing the first 5 rows of the 
       dataset for quick verification.
     * Column Analysis: A detailed table listing every column’s data type, 
       missing value count, and unique value count.
   
   - User Deliverable: Immediate "Health Check" of their data. They know 
     instantly if the data is too dirty or too large to process.

2.2 The Cleaning Workbench
   - UI Description: A split-screen interface designed for rapid sanitation.
     * Removal Operations (Red Zone): Buttons to "Drop Rows" or "Drop Columns" 
       that contain null values, plus a dropdown to remove specific unwanted 
       columns.
     * Imputation Strategy (Blue Zone): A control panel where users select a 
       filling strategy (Mean, Zero, or Mode) and target specific columns 
       (or all numeric columns at once).
   
   - User Deliverable: A sanitized dataset. Missing values are mathematically 
     filled or removed, ensuring the code won't crash during model training.

2.3 The Transformation Lab
   - UI Description: A three-column layout for Feature Engineering.
     * Rename: Simple form to correct confusing column headers.
     * Encoding: A selection menu to convert text data (e.g., "Male/Female") 
       into machine-readable numbers (e.g., 0/1) using Label, One-Hot, or 
       Ordinal encoding.
     * Custom Mapping: An interactive list where users can manually assign 
       specific numbers to specific text values (e.g., mapping "Low" to 1).
   
   - User Deliverable: A numerically optimized dataset. Categorical text data 
     is converted into a format compatible with ML algorithms like Regression.

2.4 Interactive Visualization Studio
   - UI Description: A comprehensive plotting interface.
     * Sidebar Controls: Dropdowns to select Chart Type (Histogram, Scatter, 
       Box, 3D Scatter), X-Axis, Y-Axis, Z-Axis, Color Grouping, and Theme.
     * Main Stage: A large area rendering the generated chart.
     * Fullscreen Mode: A dedicated button that expands the chart to cover 
       the entire laptop screen utilizing the browser's native Fullscreen API.
   
   - User Deliverable: Visual insights. Users can rotate 3D plots to find 
     clusters, zoom in on outliers, and export these images for reports.


3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application follows a Monolithic MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture:

   - View (Frontend): 
     HTML5, Jinja2 templating, Bootstrap 5 (Responsive UI), Animate.css.
   
   - Controller (Backend): 
     Flask (Python) handling routing (/upload, /clean, /visualize) and requests.
   
   - Model (Data Engine): 
     A persistent Python class (DataEngine) that holds the Pandas DataFrame 
     in memory, acting as the single source of truth.


4. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Core Language: Python 3.10+
   - Web Framework: Flask 3.0.0
   - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
   - Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder)
   - Visualization: Plotly (Interactive 3D), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Static 2D)
   - Security: Werkzeug (Filename sanitization)


5. INSTALLATION GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/rmn_2178/Data_cleaner.git

2. Create virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application:
   python app.py

5. Access via browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/


6. SECURITY MEASURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Input Sanitization: All file uploads are sanitized to prevent shell 
     injection.
   - Path Isolation: Application locks file operations to the 'uploads' 
     directory.
   - Session Security: Flask session cookies are signed with a secret key.
